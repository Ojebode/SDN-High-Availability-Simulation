This code is for section 5.2 of the thesis that implements high network availability in SDN.

The code specifies the IP address of two remote controllers (OpenDaylight and HP VAN SDN controller) and port number the remote controllers will listen on for connection.

NOTE: Change IP addresses of the controller to whichever IP is assigned to the remote controllers used at the time of testing.
