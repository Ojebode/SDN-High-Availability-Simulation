REQUIREMENTS.

This code will only execute succesfully on Mininet Virtual network test bed. 
The requirements used during this thesis are listed below. However, to test this code in a physical lab, only Mininet, SDN controllers and a web browser to access the controllers GUI are needed. To view code on windows platform, download Sublime Text.
